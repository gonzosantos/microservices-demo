# Adding Programming Language to Your Software Catalog

In this guide, we will add programming language detection to your software catalog, so that each service will have a programming language property corresponding to the language used in the service.

## Key Concepts

Before implementing anything in Port, let's understand three essential building blocks:

**Blueprint**

- The schema or template that defines your data structure
- Think of it like a class in programming: it defines the properties and relationships
- Example: A blueprint for a Jira issue would define properties
  like `title`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `assignee`,
  etc., and could have relationships to other blueprints like `user`
  (for the assignee) and `project`

**Entity**

- A specific instance of a blueprint (like an object of a class)
- Contains the actual data for a service, issue, or other resource
- Example: The "payment-service" entity contains details about your payment microservice

**Mapping**

- [JQ](https://jq.getport.io) rules that convert your source data into Port entities
- Defines where to find data and how to transform it
- Example: Converting a GitHub repository's data into a service entity

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Create a Blueprint

In this example, a blueprint was created automatically when you chose GitHub as your source.

You can examine the blueprint created by clicking on the `Builder` button on the top-right (or [here](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model)) and then clicking on `Data model` and expanding the `service` blueprint.

### Step 2: Creating JavaScript Language Mappings

Let's start by creating a JavaScript detection mapping.

Add the following mapping to the GitHub mapping you created in the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING-STARTED.md).

Click on the `Builder` button on the top-right and then click on `Data sources`. Click to open the `Github` data source configuration.
In the bottom-left `Mapping` section, add the following mapping to the end of the YAML file:

**JavaScript Detection**

```yaml
- kind: file
selector:
  query: "true"
  files:
  - path: src/*/package.json
    repos:
    - microservices-demo
port:
  entity:
    mappings:
      identifier: .file.path | split("/") | .[1]
      blueprint: '"service"'
      properties:
        language: '"JavaScript"'
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you renamed your repository after forking, make sure to change like before.

**This mapping looks for package.json files in service directories to identify JavaScript/Node.js services.**

#### Line-by-line Understanding the Mapping Structure

Each mapping consists of:

- A file selector that specifies which files to look for
- A repository filter to limit the scope
- Entity mappings that:
  - Extract the service identifier from the file path, see below JQ expression details
  - Specify the blueprint type ("service")
  - Set the programming language property

The `.file.path | split("/") | .[1]` expression extracts the service name from paths like `src/<servicename>/package.json`.

This setup will automatically detect and set the programming language for each service based on the presence of language-specific files in their directories.

Of course, you can change the language name to `'NodeJS'` to `'TypeScript'` or any other language name.

### Step 3: Creating Other Language Mappings

You can create similar mappings for Python, GoLang, DotNet and Java by adding the following mapping to the GitHub mapping you created in the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING-STARTED.md).

```yaml
- kind: file
  selector:
    query: "true"
    files:
      - path: src/*/go.mod
        repos:
          - microservices-demo
  port:
    entity:
      mappings:
        identifier: .file.path | split("/") | .[1]
        blueprint: '"service"'
        properties:
          language: '"GoLang"'
- kind: file
  selector:
    query: "true"
    files:
      - path: src/*/requirements.txt
        repos:
          - microservices-demo
  port:
    entity:
      mappings:
        identifier: .file.path | split("/") | .[1]
        blueprint: '"service"'
        properties:
          language: '"Python"'
- kind: file
  selector:
    query: "true"
    files:
      - path: src/*/*.sln
        repos:
          - microservices-demo
  port:
    entity:
      mappings:
        identifier: .file.path | split("/") | .[1]
        blueprint: '"service"'
        properties:
          language: '"DotNet"'
- kind: file
  selector:
    query: "true"
    files:
      - path: src/*/build.gradle
        repos:
          - microservices-demo
  port:
    entity:
      mappings:
        identifier: .file.path | split("/") | .[1]
        blueprint: '"service"'
        properties:
          language: '"Java"'
```
